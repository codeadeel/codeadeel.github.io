In this section, I'll be sharing my experiments with you on this blog. These come from my curiosity and the happiness I feel when I figure things out. There’s no strict plan here—I’m just following my interests and seeing where they lead. I believe the best way to learn is by doing it yourself, and I’m glad to share what I go through with you. We’ll explore things like new technology, coding, DIY projects, and some science too. Each post will show a part of my learning journey. I’ll tell you what I think, what works, and what doesn’t, hoping it might get you curious as well. Feel free to join me, share your thoughts, or try your own experiments. It’s all about learning together!

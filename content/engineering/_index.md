![Engineering Section](https://storage.googleapis.com/codeadeel-github/Generic/Blogger/engineeringMainBanner.jpg)

In this section, I’ll look into system design and building. I like to try new ideas to make projects that are important. My aim is to offer a simple guide on how I think about, design, and build complex systems using new tools and technologies. This space is here to help, whether I’m working on systems that can grow, mixing different technologies, or testing new ways of doing things. I do my best to explain hard ideas in easy steps, so we can both turn our big ideas into real projects that matter, doing it well and quickly.
